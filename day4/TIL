# TIL: Machine Learning Basics & Algorithms

## how ML wark
- 2 type of it: supervised and unsupervised
- what they do:
- supervised: regression (predict numbers, like price) & classification (predict categories, like "spam")
- unsupervised: clustering (grouping things) & dimensionality reduction (simplify data)

## supervised: regression vs classification
- regression: predict continuous value (e.g., predict IMU roll angle)
- classification: predict discrete value (e.g., Class A or Class B)
- Logistic Regression: don't let the name fool u, it's actually for binary classification

## the "all-rounders" (can do both)
some algos are cool and solve both regression & classification:
- Decision Tree:
- tree structure with nodes (rules) and leaves (results)
- pros: easy to understand
- cons: easy to overfit (needs normalization)
- Random Forest:
- a "forest" of many decision trees
- use "majority vote" (classification) or "averaging" (regression)
- much more robust than a single tree
- k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors):
- find 'k' closest neighbors to decide
- no "training" phase, just memorizes the whole dataset
- Neural Networks:
- inspired by brain neurons
- layers: Input -> Hidden -> Output
- "Backpropagation" is how it learns by adjusting weights to minimize error

## semi-supervised: the middle ground
- what: hybrid of supervised + unsupervised
- when to use: u have a tiny bit of labeled data but a ton of unlabeled data
- how: train a model on labeled data -> predict "pseudo-labels" for the rest -> retrain together

## real-world apps (from the lab)
- UAV (Drones): using CNN/MLP to predict orientation or flight maneuvers
- HAR (Human Activity Recognition): using Decision Trees or 1D-CNN to tell if u r walking, sitting, or falling
- IMU Data: using regression to correct sensor noise and drift
